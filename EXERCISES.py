1. SET UP THE BENCH AND BARBELL

- Position the Bench: Place the bench in the middle of the rack with the barbell directly above your chest when lying down. Ensure your head, shoulders, and hips remain flat on the bench.
- Adjust the Barbell: Set the barbell at chest height. Check that it‚Äôs evenly loaded with weights on both sides and secured with collars.



2. PROPER FORM

- Grip: Place your hands on the barbell slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. Keep your grip firm but not excessively tight.
- Elbow Position: Keep your elbows at a 45-degree angle to your torso. Do not let them flare out too much to avoid shoulder strain.
- Pressing the Barbell: Push the barbell upward, extending your arms fully, but do not lock your elbows.



3. EXECUTING THE LIFT

- Lowering the Barbell: Slowly lower the barbell to your chest, keeping your elbows at a 45-degree angle.
- Push Through the Chest: Push the barbell back to the starting position, focusing on using your chest muscles rather than your shoulders or triceps.

- Push Up: Raise your heels as high as possible by extending your ankles and contracting your calves.
- Full Contraction: Pause at the top to fully engage the calf muscles.

- Slowly lower your heels back to the starting position, stretching the calves at the bottom.
